# Things To Know Before You Start {.text-[var(--font-accent)]}

## This page will be an overview of things to know and understand before you start this project

### Software is not final

Bugs can and will occur which may hinder the experience or useability at times.
Do not expect 100% reliable and perfect function in a production scenario. Not all features are fully developed yet, though 90% of features work reliably in our testing.

### Firmware may have user difficulties

Our firmware has not been tested widely so issues may creep up, please make sure to report them if you find any.

### Documentation may be incomplete

Important steps may be missing, please report them if you find any.
